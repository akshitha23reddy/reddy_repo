Closing Your Strategy Gap For Lasting Growth
Every business dreams of soaring to new heights, yet many find themselves grounded by the elusive "strategy gap”; that space between where you are and where you want to be—a chasm that impedes growth and stifles potential. We specialize in bridging this divide and this new alignment becomes a force multiplier.
Sustainable growth requires that strategy cascade across the company. Any initiatives should include your team's input and institutional knowledge, not excluded from it, whether at ideation or execution. Our unique hybrid approach combines both the best of third party consulting with a collaborative, inclusive coaching approach that gathers all stakeholders to the solution under the same tent.

H2: Immediate and Actionable Insights
Beyond static and canned reporting; unlike traditional consultants, we coach your team with battle-tested processes, frameworks, playbooks and roadmaps that provide rapid, measurable and actionable change.

H1: Regardless of the Winds-of-Change, a Good Customer Experience is Always a Good Call
Posted on April 15, 2024
As we wade through the fog of predictions about the 2024 economy – inflation, interest rates,  election year impacts, the fading of the COVID economy - it is increasingly difficult to identify  the areas for most opportunity in gaining new customers and increasing loyalty of those already  in the fold. Even analytic approaches, which many companies rely on to prioritize their  marketing spending, are less confident when assumptions about how things are trending - in  actuality or perceived by Customers - are shaky or outright wrong.
One surefire way to ensure your dollars are being well-spent is continued investment in  Customer loyalty and improving the "Customer Experience". While it is a tried-&-true business  axiom about the maximal value of nurturing Customer loyalty, we have seen greater pressure  for businessesto hold onto Customers and their dollars, as buyers have more options – whether in delivery, pricing, discounting and where & how to buy, etc. -- for having their  spending lured away.
Focusing on the Customer Experience - the notion that the way buyers “experience” our  business in our intersections with them can lead to a favorable attitude towards our business - is central to achieving the goal of loyalty. It is this stripped-down view, the intent and focus that  makes Customer Experience (“CX” as it is often short-handed) an essential and worthwhile  mission for businesses.
Add on top, effective CX can work to not only capture more loyalty business, but can be an  effective conversion tool once a new buyer enters our store and through a positive experience  identifies our business as their preferred choice next time around.
As with the growth of analytics and digital marketing approaches over the years, technology is a  great equalizer for small and mid-sized businesses in the ability to deliver a positive Customer  Experience. The central need is defining the underlying strategy that understands who your  customers are, what they are seeking, and how we believe our product or service can meet  their need in the way we want cost-effectively associated with our brand.
So, where to start
- Think about the different customer types you serve: Typically, these are referred to as  personas or profiles. Using available data, we can begin filling-out the picture of who  these different Customer groups are. Perhaps we have a retail business where we have  buyers who come into our establishment and also order online…or perhaps others that  are exclusive to a particular channel or purchase type. Maybe ours is a business with  many one-time visitors that we may want to convert to repeat customers through the  experience we offer. While there are no doubt combinations and permutations of buyer  types, typically 4-6 standard profiles are useful in gaining the understanding we seek to  differentiate various Customer groups.
- Think about what these different Customer types seek: For each group, what do these  buyers seek? Not just in choice of product or service, but in how they want it provided.  Does it require close interaction? Does this customer seek a self-service approach? Are they price sensitive? Are they looking for many options or choices? Maybe time  sensitive or perhaps ease in payment or access… Understanding these wants will help us  to more closely provide an experience that satisfies a buyer while also being workable  for our business.
- Implement and try different methods and approaches: Once an understanding is  gained, it is time for action. This need not be all-consuming, all-encompassing and  budget-breaking. Short of alterations which require structural changes – new  equipment, facilities, etc. – most experience components can be experimented and  trialed before deciding that we have the right formula for a buyer type. Perhaps it  doesn’t make sense for a different experience for each buyer persona, so focusing on  the most important buyer types, or bundling those with similar needs together, may  make the most sense.
- Monitor and track: Buyers are not static; they change, their needs and wants change, and they are influenced by experiences outside of what your business does. Often referred to as the Customer Journey – to describe the road a buyer follows to purchase  and advocacy—the word journey also describes for us, the journey we are on in  uncovering, discovering and meeting our Customers’ needs in ways that satisfy them  and builds our business.
As buyers and consumers, you are exposed daily to experiences good and bad, from large multi national enterprises to small local businesses. And while the customer experience provided to a  large business-to-business buyer of a multi-million dollar manufacturing machine or software  may have multiple steps, processes, and a multi-year timeline - complete with other influencers  and a journey that crosses channels and departments - the basics of identifying the different  buying groups and their needs, wants and expectations remain as central as it does for a local  business selling to buyers whose purchases may be of much lower dollar amount and greater  impulse. The tools may be different; the available data to create to profiles may be more vast  and deep; but the intention is the same—how to provide this buyer with an experience to have  them select us the next time they have the needs we are hoping to meet.

H1: Revisiting Marketing Analytics work of years past: It’s still about strategy alignment and bottom line results
Posted on April 17, 2024
I recently had an opportunity to present analytic work that was completed a few years back, which at the time was notable in its broad scope, area of focus and earning the ANA Genius Award for Analytic Innovation the year it was completed. (Earlier blog “Finding New Venues and Champions for Business Benefit").
As I looked back over the earlier presentation to contextualize it for an audience of senior Marketing leaders who were interested in how to leverage analytics within their live Customer events, I was surprised at how resonant the work remained.
But wait, we didn’t have a unified platform for the 20+ data sources, we didn’t have a big data environment for the unstructured and social data, we scored all of our models offline before using them, we didn’t have a Marketing automation engine to feed the data and outputs into...and the list can go on, as you recall the state of MarTech and data in 2015.
So, what resonated and was compelling to the audience?
In short, the work was well-aligned to the Marketing strategy it supported, and it demonstrated measurable value and enabled bottom line results. Specifically, my retelling identified 4 steps followed in doing so:
Unordered List: Re-framing and re-aligning typical Marketing Analytic efforts and assets for the purpose of making Customer events more effective and part of the overall Marketing mix, Thinking end-to-end and bottom-to-top in bringing analytics to bear - addressing the “right audience” before the event, at-event attendee experience, and post event follow-up, while working in analytic layers from business intelligence, through scoring, alerting and Customer sentiment., Executing Deeply, from data gathering to analytic development through applying to business processes and activities., Making it impactful and personal in the delivery of the insights and their alignment and impact to the strategies supported.
Upon reflection, the real benefit of revisiting and sharing the work was less about a framework for what was done and how, and much more a reminder---an inspiration---to the Marketing leaders in attendance of the power of analytics in service of their Marketing goals. While the tools and technologies have improved, the clear linkage to the strategy and a focus on bottom-line results remains the essence in bringing analytics to bear.

H1: Big Data’s biggest opportunity: Finding new venues and champions for business benefit
Posted on April 17, 2024
For Marketers and data-driven business people, big data is often viewed as a way to go deeper...more data volume to apply to the problems we’ve been dealing with, adding social data or other variety to areas we’ve investigated before, or enabling faster turnaround, velocity, to accelerate outcomes. But the bigger opportunities may be in the area of a 4th “V”, addressing new venues for business benefit of analytics.
The attention to big data---considered hype by data veterans---has created a receptive and interested group of previous outsiders that are eager to embrace the promise of big data. They are coming to the party excited and ready to move forward--unjaded by the fabled data quality issues, undaunted by the reported length of the analytical cycle, nor discouraged by eye-glazing reports and presentations. They see a new and vibrant opportunity to inform and expand their strategies and invigorate their business with Customer insight. They are the new consumers of the analysis, new customers to the analysts, and are helping to change the landscape of analytics work and bringing new life and meaning to being data-driven.
Like many companies, we at SAP have wrung much value out of insights deployed to Marketing: managing the Marketing mix, finding the right Customers, improving the experience and creating engagement. But, new areas have emerged that we had not served or foresaw through our traditional Marketing analytics work - Customer Events, where SAP engages directly with our Customers and showcases software, is one such area.

H3: Introducing Insight-Driven Events
Events were outside of the traditional Marketing work, with the exception of typical campaign ROI measurement; somehow, not viewed as an area that could benefit by analytic approaches that governed campaigns and digital tactics, perhaps due to the open-ended nature and limited ability to understand activities and outcomes that occur outside of a “measurable” channel or activity. There were, however, a welcoming, eager and forward-looking group of individuals on the Events team work who asked “why not?”...and we couldn’t agree more.
Beginning about 3 years ago, SAP began a journey that we referred to as “Insight-Driven Events”, adding more analytic approaches, tools and outcomes each year until we had an end- to-end approach (from pre-event through post-event) with depth and layers of insight that look at the event composition and content, as well as attendee experience and the trajectory of outcomes.
Having crossed the imaginary barrier that separated Events from other Marketing analytic activity, it was easy to see that Events provided a vibrant hive of intensified, concentrated and magnified Marketing activity, beginning with identification of the right attendees (targeting, interest, buyers journey stages), engagement...ne immersion...in the experience (content, networking, meetings, etc.), outcomes and follow-up (solution interest, intent to purchase, etc.). Include an overlay of social media activity to punctuate and amplify interest, a laboratory to see (and hear!) directly the linkage between Customer intent and follow-through, and a mechanism that connects Marketing to Sales and Operations through the common currency of analytics, and we have a powerful fulcrum for fast learning and recycling insights back into business strategy and execution.
“Connect Marketing to Sales and Operations through the common currency of analytics”
Through partnership with a client that is eager to see and hear “what the event is telling us”, we have expanded this model each year, and have together moved to understanding individuals and audiences attending, not merely attending companies. Timing...and timeliness...of insight delivery is key to having this happen. Insights are required in time for planning cycles (which are close to a year in advance) and delivered in a way that is consumable, tied to business strategies and key objectives, and easily understood in context of the event...in short, the insights weave into the events process, not the other way around.

H3: Key Takeaways
Lessons being learned through this program are being applied to other pockets of analytic development and encourage more expansive analytical thinking:
Unordered List: Think beyond known or traditional borders of the work...find new venues., Intertwine analytics within a focused business process or in-motion activity., Recognize and encourage taking novel and different approaches, when linked to clear business strategies and needs (i.e. understanding attendee experience and event-attending personas), Combining analytic modes and methods to have a cumulative effect when focused directly onto a clear topic (i.e. insights from surveys, focus groups, scanner data and sensor readings to understand areas of value and interest within the event), Find sponsors who are champions, advocates and analytical optimists, excited about the possibilities and opportunities, and eager to gain the benefits
The Insight-Driven Events program results have spoken for themselves. Insights have informed strategic changes to the portfolio of Customer Events undertaken, have improved direct event ROI, and have influenced changes to the event operation and attendee experience. It has become clear, that to have continuous improvement to Customer Events at SAP--which are already achieving at a high level--analytics is a critical tool in identifying those areas of incremental benefit.
“Open minds and imaginations to new venues that big data can benefit”
While we have seen obvious and direct benefit from applying analytics to Events, we have had an equally impactful, and perhaps longer-term, benefit of opening our minds and imaginations to new venues, where insights from big data are influencing and directing new found opportunities for business impact.
Have you found your new venue for analytically-driven business success?

H1: Revisiting Spending Time with Customers
Posted on April 17, 2024
We are consumed with "doing," making forward progress; perhaps even more than usual these days, as COVID has us rethinking what and how we move forward. But in a recent discussion with MBA Consumer Behavior students at Babson College, I found myself instinctively making the recommendation of deeper listening before taking action, especially with Customers.
More specifically, I recalled the many good experiences I have had spending time and listening to Customers, and relating how those instances, while a small percentage of my overall career, have had an oversized impact on my education, perspective, and instincts as a marketer. Without thinking, I could hear the words coming forth about the value of being with Customers, “getting out from behind your desk and meeting them”, listening to them directly, learning more in one hour with them than in weeks reviewing information about them; hearing them, feeling their needs, seeing what matters to them and helping them succeed.
I have been fortunate to have worked with leaders who modeled this behavior and made it possible for me to get out-and-about. From meeting with American Express clients who accepted “The Card”, as part of their business-building and cooperative marketing efforts; to driving with an account rep 60 miles east of San Diego into the desert to meet with a small automotive business to understand how our products were helping him build his small business...and would he be renewing his Yellow Page advertising that year. Me in my suit and tie, my colleague in khakis and golf shirt, our client in coveralls that showed the grease and marks of his daily work. Really want to know the product you’re selling? Get out and see it the way the Customer does.
But it’s not just the learning, it has fostered a genuine regard for Customers and I often think of these times as highlights within certain jobs. In one instance, spending days at an RV rally in Salem Oregon with 1,000’s of customers; RVers, mostly senior citizens, who paid us millions of dollars of memberships fees each year and bought an even greater amount of related products. These were our people!
Growing up in NYC, RVs and the “RV lifestyle” were new and novel to me. Meeting with these welcoming people, all looking to share their experiences and affection for our products, was enlightening and invigorating. On the opposite end of the spectrum was spending days with CIOs and senior IT and business executives who were my guests at SAP’s largest worldwide event. Over several days together, I would eat with them, informally get to know them and their businesses, formally interview, survey, focus group and observe them, all to the end of SAP being able to better meet their needs--which I believe we did.
In between, there are many more stories, including meeting with our customers’ customers in order to help them in their quest to market better; whether that be observing the ritual of a mom preparing dinner with our customer’s product as a way to “nurture her family”, or listening to a middle-aged man explain how the quality of our customer’s internet service made their online experience feel as if were back with loved ones in their homeland.
In the end, I was able to offer the students these points as they pursue Consumer Behavior:
Unordered List: Every minute spent listening to a Customer is the most valuable way to spend...invest...that time;, Spending time with customers makes you a better, more empathetic marketer, and..., Even makes you a better analyst, as you gain a greater context for understanding what data, research, and insights are saying;, As one student noted, “this is hard, being able to pull back (from doing), and focus on listening to Customers”; I agreed, and hastened to add, “but it’s worth it.”
Have you spoken to a Customer lately?

H1: As businesses evolve,  It’s time to revisit, re- imagine and re- invigorate our analytic  strategy
Posted on April 17, 2024
Knowledgeable, experienced experts, and mavens are talking about a post-pandemic new normal, providing their best thoughts, research, experience, and examples from past economic calamities in identifying what’s ahead. Of course, no one knows for sure, but two topics that will certainly matter for businesses to evolve and adapt will be:
Ordered List: Changing buyer behavior, whether consumers or businesses., How analytics and insight will be key to understanding and acting upon it.
Taking a Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Analytics Officer focus to driving strategy, Customer experience, Marketing...
Marketers have over decades built mechanisms to listen and respond to changing behaviors, and I expect those will continue especially with talented marketers realizing the sea changes occurring and the need to do so. But, for analytics, there is a unique opportunity to use this disruption and discontinuity to revisit, re-imagine, and re-invigorate the analytic strategy -- defining what, where, and how analytics will deliver outsized business value.
Analytics have been on a steep growth trajectory as most industries have adopted analytics to impact revenue or bottom-line results. On this trajectory, once an analytic program has been introduced, “more is better” becomes the informal mantra, and one that is hard to disagree with.
The challenge we now face is if doing more in a business-as-usual manner -- in areas where we’ve become expert such as optimizing a campaign or supply chain, etc. -- is where analytics will continue to provide the most value. Perhaps, focusing on strategic questions about customer behaviors and drivers, business continuity, scenario planning, and using analytics as an asset for customers may be new opportunities. In short, re-committing analytics with a sharp and renewed focus to emerging “new normal” business strategies:
Unordered List: A focus on “Trusted Customer Relationships” (per the CMO Survey and others) which implies:A deeper focus and understanding of customer opportunity and value (LTV).More Account-Based Marketing approaches in B2B.Accelerating analytics that support the customer experience., Changing buyer needs (per McKinsey and others) whether B2C or B2B, implies:Greater broad-based insight development.Greater use of segmentation.More experimentation and testing., More analytics in the delivery of a product or service, including how our analytics can help our customers—whether consumers and businesses—overcome changes in their world. This has the added advantage of also bolstering trusted customer relationships.
Business-wide scenario planning, continuity planning, and addressing ad-hoc strategic topics.
To be sure, these aren’t necessarily new ideas, though they will garner increased attention and provide a window within a changing business to shift how analytics can matter. How will analytics adapt and pivot to be in alignment with a changing business? What will these new areas of focus mean for analytic strategy and teams?
Unordered List: An even greater demand and reliance on analytics, used in even an even wider set of business situations, atop already-running analytic programs that are still needed, in some cases more than ever., A need to focus not on everything, but the right things., A clearly articulated analytic strategy that identifies where and how business value is delivered and aligned to the evolving business strategy and model., Creating capacity in new areas, especially those that are not encumbered with day-to-day analytic deliverables but open to large-scale broad learning., More agility in creating faster turnarounds, switching topics, and the need for more analytics at the point of decision-making., More leadership in defining analytics within the context of the changing strategy, and a clear demonstration of where and how value is created for internal stakeholders, Customers, and Partners.
Of course, we are still dealing in a world of unknowns, but we do know that focusing more in areas around customers and taking a mindset to not automatically just "pick-up where we left-off" is a prudent way forward. We need to seize this opportunity—the disruption---to revisit, re-imagine, and re-invigorate the analytic strategy as a key value driver in the emerging new business approaches. Let’s start our next analytic journey!

Posted on April 17, 2024
This is an interesting article regarding the use of data from shared scooter users and how it can be used to improve traffic conditions and reduce congestion as we move to a multi-modal approach to transportation within cities.
Being data-driven is a good thing, ensuring that decisions are focused in the right places and at the right magnitude. Taking a Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Analytics Officer focus to driving strategy, Customer experience, Marketing...
That said, I do have a few concerns related to the article and the topic generally, the first around privacy, which needs to be central to using any analytics:
It is noted in the article that while data collected is being collected about their usage patterns, scooter users are anonymous. I do not see how this can be true, since a smartphone is used to unlock the scooters. It is easy enough to then combine this journey information with other data gathered from that individual device, and also easy to make the user identifiable and multi-attributed by combining other data outside of what’s captured directly in the journey. Is the user actually anonymous?
The article accurately assumes an overall permissive attitude towards privacy: “…privacy is a serious concern, but not a showstopper, given that our smartphones already feed generous helpings to any number of data-digesting apps.” I am not sure it is accurate, though, to assume that most users realize their privacy is being breached, their patterns collected, and if they did perhaps it wouldn’t be “ok” to be used without their permission, particularly on an individual level. Further, it is dangerous to assume consent to data gathering “because people are used to it”; clarity must be provided to what will be gathered and how used, and specific consent granted, in more than small print. Perhaps given the many good intended uses of the data, most consumers would happily grant it, and be willing to provide more.
Using a data and analytics approach to address transportation issues is an excellent one and existed -- through surveys, monitoring of intersections etc. -- long before we had the current ability to gather terabytes of data quickly and easily, and should be encouraged. That said, we cannot be solely data-driven, but must also bring other perspectives and strategies to bear on the problem - data should illuminate and support our intended strategies or identify hidden opportunities, but on their own they are not a solution, except one that uses data to solve a problem for which optimization is the only goal. We know that in city and neighborhood planning there are other priorities at play other than strictly efficiency of commute, but safety, character of the neighborhood, wants and desires of the residents, and so on. In this way, data and analytics can shine very bright lights on proposed solutions and foster productive discussions, but must be done so in accordance with respect for the people involved, starting with protecting their privacy and consent to use their data, and those for whom it not just about the commute.
